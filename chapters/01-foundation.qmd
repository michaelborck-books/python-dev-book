# Setting the Foundation

## Python Project Structure Best Practices

A well-organized project structure is the cornerstone of maintainable Python code. Even before writing a single line of code, decisions about how to organize your files will impact how easily you can test, document, and expand your project.

The structure we recommend follows modern Python conventions, prioritizing clarity and separation of concerns:

```
my_project/
├── src/                    # Main source code directory
│   └── my_package/         # Your actual Python package
│       ├── __init__.py     # Makes the directory a package
│       ├── main.py         # Core functionality
│       └── helpers.py      # Supporting functions/classes
├── tests/                  # Test suite
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── test_main.py        # Tests for main.py
│   └── test_helpers.py     # Tests for helpers.py
├── docs/                   # Documentation (can start simple)
│   └── index.md            # Main documentation page
├── .gitignore              # Files to exclude from Git
├── README.md               # Project overview and quick start
├── requirements.txt        # Project dependencies
└── pyproject.toml          # Tool configuration
```

### Why Use the `src` Layout?

The `src` layout (placing your package inside a `src` directory rather than at the project root) provides several advantages:

1. **Enforces proper installation**: When developing, you must install your package to use it, ensuring you're testing the same way users will experience it.
2. **Prevents accidental imports**: You can't accidentally import from your project without installing it, avoiding confusing behaviors.
3. **Clarifies package boundaries**: Makes it explicit which code is part of your distributable package.

While simpler projects might skip this layout, adopting it early builds good habits and makes future growth easier.

### Key Components Explained

- **src/my_package/**: Contains your actual Python code. The package name should be unique and descriptive.
- **tests/**: Keeps tests separate from implementation but adjacent in the repository.
- **docs/**: Houses documentation, starting simple and growing as needed.
- **.gitignore**: Tells Git which files to ignore (like virtual environments, cache files, etc.).
- **README.md**: The first document anyone will see—provide clear instructions on installation and basic usage.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists your project's dependencies. We'll explore more advanced dependency management techniques in Part 2.
- **pyproject.toml**: Configuration for development tools like Ruff and mypy, following modern standards.

### Getting Started

Creating this structure is straightforward. Here's how to initialize a basic project:

```bash
# Create the project directory
mkdir my_project && cd my_project

# Create the basic structure
mkdir -p src/my_package tests docs

# Initialize the Python package
touch src/my_package/__init__.py
touch src/my_package/main.py

# Create initial test files
touch tests/__init__.py
touch tests/test_main.py

# Create essential files
echo "# My Project\nA short description of my project." > README.md
touch requirements.in
touch pyproject.toml

# Initialize Git repository
git init
```

### Applications vs. Packages: Knowing Your Project Type

Understanding whether you're building an **application** or a **package** influences structure decisions and development priorities:

**Python Applications** are end-user focused programs:
- Web applications (Django/Flask projects)
- Command-line tools and utilities
- Desktop applications
- Data processing scripts
- Have clear entry points and user interfaces
- Often include configuration files and deployment considerations

**Python Packages** are developer-focused libraries:
- Reusable code modules (like `requests` or `pandas`)
- APIs and frameworks
- Plugin systems
- Focus on import interfaces and documentation
- Published to PyPI for others to use

**Key Differences in Practice:**

| Aspect | Applications | Packages |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Entry point** | `main.py`, CLI commands | Import interfaces |
| **Dependencies** | Can pin exact versions | Should use flexible ranges |
| **Documentation** | User guides, deployment | API docs, examples |
| **Testing focus** | End-to-end workflows | Unit tests, edge cases |
| **Configuration** | Settings files, env vars | Initialization parameters |

**Most projects start as applications** and may later extract reusable components into packages. Our recommended structure accommodates both paths—you can begin with application-focused development and naturally evolve toward package-like modularity as your codebase matures.

> **Note**: This chapter focuses on script-based projects, but notebooks (Jupyter, Colab) are also a legitimate way to ship Python work. For data scientists, educators, and researchers, a well-structured notebook with a sharing link *is* shipping. We cover notebooks, dashboards, and interactive tools in @sec-notebooks.

**Practical example**: A data analysis script (application) might extract its core algorithms into a separate analytics package, while keeping the command-line interface and configuration handling in the main application.

This structure promotes maintainability and follows Python's conventions. It might seem like overkill for tiny scripts, but as your project grows, you'll appreciate having this organization from the start.

In the next section, we'll build on this foundation by implementing version control best practices.

## Version Control Fundamentals

Version control is an essential part of modern software development, and Git has become the de facto standard. Even for small solo projects, proper version control offers invaluable benefits for tracking changes, experimenting safely, and maintaining a clear history of your work.

### Setting Up Git

If you haven't set up Git yet, here's how to get started:

```bash
# Configure your identity (use your actual name and email)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Initialize Git in your project (if not done already)
git init

# Create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files
```

A good `.gitignore` file is essential for Python projects. Here's a simplified version to start with:

```
# Virtual environments
.venv/
venv/
env/

# Python cache files
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
.pytest_cache/

# Distribution / packaging
dist/
build/
*.egg-info/

# Local development settings
.env
.vscode/
.idea/

# Coverage reports
htmlcov/
.coverage

# Generated documentation
site/
```

### Basic Git Workflow

For beginners, a simple Git workflow is sufficient:

1. **Make changes** to your code
2. **Stage changes** you want to commit
3. **Commit** with a meaningful message
4. **Push** to a remote repository (like GitHub)

Here's what this looks like in practice:

```bash
# Check what files you've changed
git status

# Stage specific files (or use git add . for all changes)
git add src/my_package/main.py tests/test_main.py

# Commit changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add user authentication function and tests"

# Push to a remote repository (if using GitHub or similar)
git push origin main
```

### Effective Commit Messages

Good commit messages are vital for understanding project history. Follow these simple guidelines:

1. Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
2. Keep the first line under 50 characters as a summary
3. When needed, add more details after a blank line
4. Explain *why* a change was made, not just *what* changed

Example of a good commit message:
```
Add password validation function

- Implements minimum length of 8 characters
- Requires at least one special character
- Fixes #42 (weak password vulnerability)
```

### Branching for Features and Fixes

As your project grows, a branching workflow helps manage different streams of work:

```bash
# Create a new branch for a feature
git checkout -b feature/user-profiles

# Make changes, commit, and push to the branch
git add .
git commit -m "Add user profile page"
git push origin feature/user-profiles

# When ready, merge back to main (after review)
git checkout main
git merge feature/user-profiles
```

For team projects, consider using pull/merge requests on platforms like GitHub or GitLab rather than direct merges to the main branch. This enables code review and discussion before changes are incorporated.

### Integrating with GitHub or GitLab

Hosting your repository on GitHub, GitLab, or similar services provides:

1. A backup of your code
2. Collaboration tools (issues, pull requests)
3. Integration with CI/CD services
4. Visibility for your project

To connect your local repository to GitHub:

```bash
# After creating a repository on GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my_project.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Git Best Practices for Beginners

1. **Commit frequently**: Small, focused commits are easier to understand and review
2. **Never commit sensitive data**: Passwords, API keys, etc. should never enter your repository
3. **Pull before pushing**: Always integrate others' changes before pushing your own
4. **Use meaningful branch names**: Names like `feature/user-login` or `fix/validation-bug` explain the purpose

Version control may seem like an overhead for very small projects, but establishing these habits early will pay dividends as your projects grow in size and complexity. It's much easier to start with good practices than to retrofit them later.

In the next section, we'll set up a virtual environment and explore basic dependency management to isolate your project and manage its requirements.

## Virtual Environments and Basic Dependencies

Python's flexibility with packages and imports is powerful, but can quickly lead to conflicts between projects. Virtual environments solve this problem by creating isolated spaces for each project's dependencies.

### Understanding Virtual Environments

A virtual environment is an isolated copy of Python with its own packages, separate from your system Python installation. This isolation ensures:

* Different projects can use different versions of the same package
* Installing a package for one project won't affect others
* Your development environment closely matches production

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment with `venv`

Python comes with `venv` built in, making it the simplest way to create virtual environments:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named ".venv" in your project
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the environment (the command differs by platform)
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Your prompt should change to indicate the active environment
(venv) $
```

Once activated, any packages you install will be confined to this environment. When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

> **Tip**: Using `.venv` as the environment name (with the leading dot) makes it hidden in many file browsers, reducing clutter. Make sure `.venv/` is in your `.gitignore` file - you never want to commit this directory.

### Basic Dependency Management

With your virtual environment active, you can install packages using pip:

```bash
# Install a specific package
pip install requests

# Install multiple packages
pip install pytest black
```

When working on a team project or deploying to production, you'll need to track and share these dependencies. For basic projects, you can manually maintain a `requirements.txt` file with the packages you need:

```bash
# Create or add packages to your requirements.txt file
echo "requests" >> requirements.txt
echo "pytest" >> requirements.txt

# Install from your requirements file
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This approach works well for simple projects, especially when you're just getting started. However, as we'll see in Part 2, there are limitations to this basic method:

* It doesn't handle indirect dependencies (dependencies of your dependencies) automatically
* It doesn't distinguish between your project's requirements and development tools
* It doesn't provide version locking for reproducible environments

> **Looking Ahead**: In Part 2, we'll explore more robust dependency management with tools like pip-tools and uv, which solve these limitations by creating proper "lock files" while maintaining a clean list of direct dependencies. We'll also see how these tools help ensure deterministic builds - a crucial feature as your projects grow in complexity.

### Practical Example: Setting Up a New Project

Let's combine what we've learned so far with a practical example. Here's how to set up a new project with good practices:

```bash
# Create project structure
mkdir -p my_project/src/my_package my_project/tests
cd my_project

# Initialize Git repository
git init
echo "*.pyc\n__pycache__/\n.venv/\n*.egg-info/" > .gitignore

# Create basic files
echo "# My Project\n\nA description of my project." > README.md
touch src/my_package/__init__.py
touch src/my_package/main.py
touch tests/__init__.py
touch tests/test_main.py
touch requirements.in

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install initial dependencies
pip install pytest
echo "pytest" > requirements.txt

# Initial Git commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup"
```

## Jumpstarting Your Projects with Templates

Now that we've covered the essential foundation for Python development, you might be wondering how to apply these practices efficiently when starting new projects. Rather than recreating this structure manually each time, we offer two approaches to jumpstart your projects:

### Simple Scaffolding Script

For those who prefer a transparent, straightforward approach, we've created a simple bash script that creates the basic project structure we've discussed:

```bash
# Download the script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michael-borck/ship-python-template/main/scripts/scaffold_python_project.sh
chmod +x scaffold_python_project.sh

# Create a new project
./scaffold_python_project.sh my_project
```

This script creates a minimal but well-structured Python project with:
- The recommended `src` layout
- Basic test setup
- Simple `pyproject.toml` configuration
- Version control initialization
- Placeholder documentation

The script is intentionally simple and readable, allowing you to understand exactly what's happening and modify it for your specific needs. This approach is ideal for learning or for smaller projects where you want maximum visibility into the setup process.

### Cookiecutter Template (For More Comprehensive Setup)

For more complex projects or when you want a more feature-rich starting point, we also provide a cookiecutter template that implements the full development pipeline described throughout this book:

```bash
# Install cookiecutter
pip install cookiecutter

# Create a new project from the template
cookiecutter gh:michael-borck/ship-python-cookiecutter
```

The cookiecutter template offers more customization options and includes:
- All the foundational structure from the simple script
- Comprehensive tool configurations
- Optional documentation setup with MkDocs
- CI/CD workflow configurations
- Advanced dependency management
- Security scanning integration

This approach is covered in detail in Appendix C and is recommended when you're ready to adopt more advanced practices or when working with larger teams.

### GitHub Repository Templates (For No-Installation Simplicity)

For the ultimate in simplicity, we also provide a GitHub repository template that requires no local tool installation. GitHub templates offer a frictionless way to create new projects with the same structure and files:

1. Visit the template repository at https://github.com/michael-borck/ship-python-template
2. Click the "Use this template" button
3. Name your new repository and create it
4. Clone your new repository locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-new-project.git
cd your-new-project
```

While GitHub templates don't offer the same parameterization as cookiecutter (file contents remain exactly as they were in the template), they provide the lowest barrier to entry for getting started with a well-structured project. After creating your repository from the template, you can manually customize file contents like project name, author information, and other details.

The GitHub template includes:
- The recommended `src` layout
- Basic test structure
- `.gitignore` and `pyproject.toml` configuration
- Documentation structure
- Example code and tests

This approach is ideal for quickly starting new projects when you don't want to install additional tools or when you're introducing others to Python best practices with minimal setup overhead.

All these options—the simple script, the cookiecutter template—embody, and GitHub repository templates embody our philosophy of "Simple but not Simplistic." Choose the option that best fits your current needs and comfort level. As your projects grow in complexity, you can gradually adopt more sophisticated practices while maintaining the solid foundation established here.
